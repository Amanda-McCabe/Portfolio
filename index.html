                    <h1>Hello, I am Amanda McCabe.</h1>
                    <p>I am a software engineer. I live in Nampa, Idaho.</p>
                    <p>As a former health care professional, I have always had an interest in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Helping people</li>
                        <li>Making people smile</li>
                        <li>Making life easier</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Now I am taking that passion and shifting it to software engineering. I am looking forward to
                        helping people and enriching lives by making software that makes things easier. If I can do so
                        in a way that is fun and makes people smile even better.</p>

                    <p>I am currently going to school at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful.</a> </p>
                    <p>I am loving learning from and working with other engineers. I am excited to start my new career
                        as a software engineer. </p>
                    <p>I am very much a nerd. I love anime, cosplays, board games and video games. I love to write,
                        read, draw, sing and dance. I love to spend time with my kids.</p>
                    <p>I would love to hear from anyone looking to hire a new engineer. As well as anyone wanting to
                        work on a project or build great software together.</p>

                    <p>Here are few of my projects for you to view.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://penguins.com">Penguin Information</a></li>
                        <p>This is a website I designed for a company wanting to help kids learn about penguins.</p>
                        <li><a href="https://d&dfun.com">D&D Club</a></li>
                        <p>This project was for a Dungeons and Dragons group who wanted their group to be able to play
                            together online during covid.</p>
                        <li><a href="https://dragonmonters.com">Dragons Are Real</a></li>
                        <p>I had a ton of fun building this project for my kids. They wanted a website dedicated to
                            their creative imaginations. I built this to suit them. An interactive dragon website.</p>
